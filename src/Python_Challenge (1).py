The expected output is a console application that
you can use to manage your to do list. 
It allows you to create an account and manipulate tasks

I have provided a structure for the code: FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------
                    INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------
1. Create a folder called src

2. Create the following files:
    - accounts.py
    - tasks.py
    - app.py

In the files, do the following:
'''
# --- accounts.py --
# This file contains code for managing your account

accounts = { "masete" : "nichlas"}  # dictionary where key is the  password and value is User

# Write a function adds user details to accounts



def add_account(name, password):
    
    """
    Adds the key value pair to the accounts dictionary
    """
    pass


def login(name, password):
    """
    returns true if the password and corresponding name exist in the 
    accounts dicitionary
    """
    pass


# --- tasks.py ---
# This file contains code that manages your todo_list
todo_list = []

# Write a function creates a task


def create_task(task):
    """
    Adds the task (string value) to todo_list
    """
    pass

# Write a function deletes a task


def delete_task(task):
    """
    Removes the specified task from the todo_list
    """
    pass

# Write a function that marks a task finished


def mark_as_finished(task):
    """
    Append the string label '[finished]' at the end of the task 
    if it does not already have the label appended.
    It should remain in the todo_list
    """
    pass

# Write a function deletes all tasks


def delete_all_tasks():
    """
    Empty the the todo_lsit
    """
    pass


# ---- app.py ----
# This file contains the entry point to your tasks
# and the logic to manage it

from accounts import accounts, add_account  # import the function as well
